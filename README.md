# Using Heroku to deploy servlets and JSPs

This tutorial will show you how to deploy and develop a Heroku app that runs servlets and JSPs.
There are two activities covered in this tutorial: deployment will cover how to obtain a remote repository, making a copy of it in your own repository, persisting changes from your local instance to your remote one in GitHub and automatically deploy your app in Heroku, and development will cover how to build and run your app locally.

Check the currently deployed version: https://swe432tomcat.herokuapp.com

## Prelude
We are working with two different phases of the software lifecycle: **development**(programming, debugging, program testing) and **deployment**(publishing your app in your servers so clients can use it).  Heroku offers a hosting service for your web app and can be linked with GitHub to auto-deploy it, and also offers development tools so you can run your app locally.

**Disclaimer:** Please take a moment to explore each concept, technology, command, activity and action used in this tutorial, for brevity the level of detail is limited to help you deploy servlets in Heroku. 

## Quick Reference
Use these commnads only if you already followed this tutorial and want a quick reminder of common tasks:

### Redeploying the app by pushing changes to the remote repo
```
git add . ; git commit -m "TODO: I really should explain these changes"; git push
```

### Rerunning the app locally after some edits
```
mvn package ; heroku local
```

## Create GitHub and Heroku accounts

You can create accounts for free in both platforms (do not provide any payment info).

### GitHub

Go to https://github.com/join and create your account.

### Heroku

Go to https://signup.heroku.com to create your account.

Optional: You can use the GitHub student package found at https://www.heroku.com/github-students. 

## Deployment: Create a Git repo(sitory) and and link it to a Heroku app 

If you have not installed Git before, you can get it here: https://git-scm.com/downloads.

Now, follow these steps to bring this repo into your Github account:

### 1. Get this repo locally in your machine:
This code contains all necessary boilerplate for supporting servlets and JSPs in a Heroku app:
```
git clone https://github.com/luminaxster/swe432tomcat.git
```

### 2. Create an empty repo in your Github:

a. Go to [Github](www.github.com), login into your account, select the "repositories" tab, click on "New". Once in the "Create a new repository" page: give a name to your repo, make it private and let other options default, and click on "create repository".

c. This will take you to your new repository's page. Copy the url to access your repo in the quick setup section.
It should look like this:

``` https://github.com/<your_username>/<newly_created_repo_name>.git```

We will use this URL in step 3.

### 3. Redirect the local repo to your own repo and save the changes:

Remember to replace the url from step 2 ( ``` https://github.com/<your_username>/<newly_created_repo_name>.git ``` ) with your own repo's url.

#### a. Setting up your remote repo in Git
The following commands **only need have to be used once**, in the command line:
```
cd swe432tomcat
git init
git remote set-url origin "https://github.com/<your_username>/<newly_created_repo_name>.git"
```
#### b. Push your local changes into your remote repo
The following commands **will be reused every time you want to send your changes to GitHub**, in the command line:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: cloned repo"
git push
```
Remember to be explicit with your commit messages, this will document the rationale of your code changes and be seen in each file history by everyone wanting to contribute to your project, or even you after a month not looking at the file.
### 4. Create a Heroku app

Go to https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps: click on "New" > "Create New App", provide a name, and click on "create app".

### 5. Link repo and deploy 

Once in your Heroku app web page, select the "deploy" tab:

 a. set the deploy method to "Github"
 
 b. authorize Heroku to access your GitHub repositories
 
 c. select the recently created one
 
 d. click on "connect"
 
 e. activate automatic deploys
 
 f. click on deploy the "master" branch (only this time so you can see the changes immediately)
 
 g. Once your deploy is processed, click on "View"
 
### Updating your repo and redeploying

You only have to push your changes on your repo and they will redeploy automatically.

## Development: Running your app locally

Before deploying your app in the Web, you normally program, debug and test your app locally. To do so, we will need Apache Maven to build your app and Heroku CLI to run it locally. 

#### Apache Maven installation

If you have not installed Apache Maven before, you can get the binaries here: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi, and follow the instructions here: https://maven.apache.org/install.html.

Note: if you are using a Unix-like system (e.g MacOS, Linux), you need to open a terminal and add the path to Maven permanently in your bash profile:
```
vi ~/.bash_profile
```
And add the following line to this file so Maven is runnable from the terminal from now on:
```
export PATH=/opt/apache-maven-3.6.3/bin:$PATH
```
The line above assumes Maven's path is "/opt/apache-maven-3.6.3/bin", or that your Maven download has been moved there. You can use a different path too, make sure your path is reflected in this line.

For Windows machines, add Maven's path to the PATH property in the system's environment variables.

**Note:** Reopen your terminal for the changes to be reflected.

#### Heroku CLI installation
If you have not installed the Heroku CLI  before, you can get it here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli.

For Windows machines, this repo's [Procfile](https://github.com/luminaxster/swe432tomcat/blob/master/Procfile) is set up for Unix-like machines, "sh" is the shell command in Unix . In Windows, replace the following line in the Procfile:
```
web: sh target/bin/webapp
```
 
for the following:
```
web: target\bin\webapp.bat
```
**Note:** If you are Windows user, do not push your Procfile to your remote repo. An error like this one will be thrown:
```"targetbinwebapp not found" error and then an "app crashed" error with code H10 ...```

### Build and run your app
To run the app contained in your repo, go your repo's root folder, the "POM.xml" should be there, this file is the configuration Maven uses to build your app so Heroku can run it. You should perform the following commands each time you want to run the latest version of your app, make sure there are no errors after you run them. 

Run this command in your terminal to build the app:
```
mvn package
```

And this one to run it:

```
heroku local
```

You should be able to access your app at http://localhost:5000.

### Making changes: adding a new servlet

In your machine, place your servlet file in the ```src/main/java/servlet``` folder and add the servlet annotation so your Apache Tomcat knows how to map it:
```
import javax.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;

@WebServlet( name = "servletName", urlPatterns = {"/servicePathName"} )
```
The line above handles **servlet mapping**, which makes its servlet instance available at yourServerUrl/**servicePathName**.

Now you can observe, debug or test your app locally by building your app (in terminal: ```mvn package```) and running it in your local server (in terminal: ```heroku local```). After that, ```localhost:5000/servicePathName``` (as in urlPatterns property from the annotation above) must be working.

**Note:** If your servlet mapping setup failed or is missing, the URL ```localhost:5000/servicePathName``` or ```yourWebsite/servicePathName``` won't be accessible and show a ```404: Not found error```. Make sure the @WebServlet annotation is in the desired servlet java file and the ```localhost:5000/servicePathName``` matches ```@WebServlet.. urlPatterns = {"/servicePathName"}```.

## Developing and Deploying continuous loop

Finally, once you are done making changes in your app locally -- you have achieved your development goals -- and now want to publish your app so users get the latest version -- deploy your app, pushing your local changes to your repo will automatically deploy this version of the app in your Heroku hosting (described in the Deployment section). 

## Important
After you are satisfied changing your code, remember they are still in your machine. You must push these changes to your github's web repo (remote), only then they will be visible to everybody. If you followed the steps linking your Heroku app with this repo, pushing changes in to your remote repo will redeploy your Heroku app.

## Sharing your repo with the TA
Your repo must be private at all times and for me to grade your code, please add me as a contributor. My username is luminaxster.

# Add persistence to your Heroku app
Go to your Heroku dashboard, choose your Tomcat servlet app, go to the Resources tab, click on find add-ons, type  postgres, Heroku-Postrgres will show up, select it with Hobby dev (free) tier.

**Or**, in your terminal:
```
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev --app <your_heroku_app_name>
```
**Remember:** <your_heroku_app_name> is the name of your heroku app.

## Install PostgreSQL
You can get Postgres [here](https://postgresapp.com/downloads.html) and choose your platform binaries.

*Windows:* Using the wizard will install the DB, services and basic tools we need to manage and query the database.


*Mac:* Select Postgres.app with PostgreSQL 12. Then execute this command in your terminal:

```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/paths.d &&
echo /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin | sudo tee /etc/paths.d/postgresapp
```
Reopen the terminal and try:

```which psql```

It should return a file system path like ```/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin/psql```.

### Configure the connection to your remote DB add-ons in Heroku
In order for your Java applications to access the DB via JDBC, you need to setup the connection. In your terminal, execute:
```
export JDBC_DATABASE_URL=`heroku run echo \\$JDBC_DATABASE_URL -a <your_heroku_app_name>
```
**Remember:** <your_heroku_app_name> is the name of your heroku app.

Double check the environment variable was set:
```
echo $JDBC_DATABASE_URL
```
It should return a string like ```jdbc:postgresql://...```.

**Note:** This configuration will be lost once you close the terminal, do no try to make it permanent, the crendentials are renovated often.

### Connect to you database via CLI
In your terminal, enter to your DB with the following command:
```
heroku pg:psql <your_postgresql_add_on_name> --app <your_heroku_app_name>
```
**Remember:** <your_heroku_app_name> is the name of your heroku app, and <your_postgresql_add_on_name> is your postgres add-on name.

You can get your precise command from your Postgres add-on dashboard, go to settings > admistration > view credentials > **Heroku cli**

#### Manage your database
Create the folowing table, it is required by the [DB servlet](https://github.com/luminaxster/swe432tomcat/blob/master/src/main/java/servlet/DatabaseServlet.java) to work:

```
CREATE TABLE entries( 
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
  age INT  CHECK (age > 0  AND age <150) NOT NULL
);
```

#### Try some commands
Try adding an entry:
```
INSERT INTO entries (name, age) VALUES ('Logan', 149);
```
Or querying persisted data in that table:
```
SELECT name, age FROM entries;
```
